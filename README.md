# kfd-flask

A sample Python/Flask application for the second edition of 
Kubernetes for Developers. This is just about the simplest 
possible Python/Flask application you can build. The point 
here, of course, is to show you how to package this code in 
a container image and then deploy that container image to 
Kubernetes.
